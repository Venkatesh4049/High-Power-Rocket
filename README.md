# High-Power Rocket Project

## Overview
This repository contains the design, development, and testing documentation for a high-power rocket built using kraft-phenolic composite materials and powered by a homemade KNO₃–glucose solid propellant.

The project was developed by a student team at Anna University Regional Campus, Madurai, to demonstrate low-cost, sustainable rocketry solutions.

## Features
- **Composite Body**: Kraft-phenolic laminate for strength, low weight, and thermal resistance.
- **Custom Propellant**: Potassium nitrate–glucose mixture with optimized grain geometry.
- **Nozzle Design**: De Laval nozzle for efficient thrust generation.
- **Recovery System**: Parachute deployment using ejection charge at apogee.
- **Electronics**: Modular avionics bay with sensors, telemetry, and data logging.
- **Simulations**: OpenRocket for aerodynamics, OpenMotor for propulsion modeling.
- **Testing**: Static ground tests, recovery deployment trials, and material evaluations.
