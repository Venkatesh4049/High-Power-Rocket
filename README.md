# High-Power Rocket Project

**Design and Development of a High-Power Rocket Using Composite Materials**

This repository contains the design, fabrication, and testing details of a student-built high-power rocket made from kraft-phenolic composite materials and powered by a potassium nitrate–glucose solid propellant. The project demonstrates that affordable, sustainable materials can achieve high-performance results in amateur rocketry.

## Features
- Kraft-phenolic composite body, fins, and nose cone for strength, thermal resistance, and low cost
- Custom solid propellant (KNO₃–glucose) with optimized grain geometry
- De Laval nozzle design for efficient thrust
- Parachute recovery system with ejection charge triggered at apogee
- Avionics bay with sensors, telemetry, and data logging
- Aerodynamic and propulsion simulations using OpenRocket and OpenMotor
- Static ground tests and subsystem validation
